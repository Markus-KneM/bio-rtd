## Maintenance

#### Sample Cases

* Rewrite direct instance as a function of `_t`.
* Process optimization example.

#### Testing
Unit tests:
* Add tests for intermediate data logging.
* Refactor unit tests for better code readability.

Integrated tests:
* Define strategy and implement integrated tests.


## New Features

#### Unit Operations
* PCC with irregular cycles (cycle switch based on bt criteria) and
  surge tanks that supports such process.
* `pdf` and `breakthrough_profiles` that support different

Implementation of new features should not result in expansion
of **Maintenance** section. This means that new features should be
developed with code coverage, examples and documentation.
